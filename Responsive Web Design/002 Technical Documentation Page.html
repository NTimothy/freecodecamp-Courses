                <li> Remove the swab from its pacakage, being careful not to touch the tip of the swab. Please keep the swab package for later use.</li>
                <li> Gently insert the entire absorbent tip of the swab (usually 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch) into your nostril.
                  <br><code class="note">Note: With children, the maximum depth of insertion may be less than 3/4 of an inch, and you may need to have a second person to hold the child's head while swabbing</code><br><br></li>
                  <li> Firmly and slowly brush against insides of nostril in a circular motion against the nasal wall at least 5 times. Take at least 15 seconds to collect the specimen and be sure to collect any nasal drainage on the swab. Using both the same swab, repeat the same sample collection procedure for the other nostril. Be sure to brush <span class="bold"> BOTH</span> nostrils with the <span class="bold">SAME SWAB.</span>
                  <code class="note"><br>Note: Failure to swab properly may cause false negative results.</code></li>

                  <p>Persons who test positive should self-isolate and sek follow-up care with their physician or healthcare provider as additional testing and public health reporting may be necessary</p></li>
